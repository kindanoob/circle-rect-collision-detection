# circle_rect_collision_detection
Simple implementation of circle-rectangle collision detection in C++ using SFML

Requirements: 1) C++11, 2) SFML 2.4.2

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial, gcc 5.4.0.

Instructions:
Instructions:
1) For an out-of-place build: create a build directory (mkdir build)
2) Change directory to the created build directory (cd build)
3) Create build files with CMake in the build directory (cmake ..)
4) Build the project (e.g. for Unix makefiles it is achieved by using "make" command in the terminal)
5) Launch the executable file "circle_rect_collision".
6) Keyboard controls. Use direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the circle.
7) Mouse controls. Left click on the circle and drag it across the screen.
8) When circle and rectangle collide circle's color is switched to red.
